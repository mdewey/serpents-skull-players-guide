## Adventure synopsis!

### A Tale of a Fateful Trip

The adventure starts off with the party on a merchant ship, doing its merchant things.

But what starts off pleasant and fine, but, as with all good stories, that doesn't last long.

For some for shadowing, a song, to the tune of Gilligan's Isle...

Just roll your dice and you'll play a tale<br/>
a tale of a fateful trip,<br/>
that started from some merchant ports,<br/>
aboard this mighty ship.<br/>

The mate was a mighty sailin' man,<br/>
the Skipper brave and sure,<br/>
four players set sail that day,<br/>
for a three hour tour,<br/>
a three hour tour.<br/>

The adventure starts getting rough,<br/>
the might ship was tossed.<br/>
If not for the courage of the fearless crew<br/>
the _Jenivere_ would be lost.<br/>

So this is the tale of our castaways,<br/>
they're here for a long, long time.<br/>

They'll have to make the best of things,<br/>
it's an uphill climb.<br/>

The party and NPCs<br/>
will do their very best,<br/>
to survive, defend and adapt<br/>
in their tropic island nest.<br/>

No towns, no bars, no potion shop<br/>
not a single luxury<br/>
like Robinson Crusoe,<br/>
it's primitive as can be.<br/>

So join us here each sess' my friends,<br/>
you're sure to get a smile,<br/>
from these stranded castaways<br/>
here with Serpents Skull!<br/>

# Some house rules

## 3rd party material

3rd party material can only be used with DM approval.

## Skills

We will use the background skills alternative rules.

### FULL EXPLANATION

https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/background-skills/

### NORMAL

A player only gets the number of skills per level that are based by class

#### NEW RULE TL;DR;

Skills are now broken down into 2 different types, adventure and background. In addition to receiving the normal amount of
skill points every level to go into any skills, a player now also receives 2 addition skill point to but into only background skills. This allows players to have skills that reflect their backstory without having to sacrifice play-ability

## Skill checks

A nat 20 on skill checks doesn't necessaryly mean auto success, but will help you in some way, and conversely, a nat 1 on a skill check doesn't automatically mean failure, but something will happened.

example 1:

_player_: I want to run and jump the bed. _rolls a nat 1_

_DM_: Okay, you go to jump and trip and you are on the bed, but prone

example 2:

_player_: I want to run to know more about this manticore. _rolls a nat 20_

_DM_: Okay, you know most things about it, let me tell you about how its going to fight you.

## Bottle Caps

### FULL EXPLANATION

A player can earn bottle caps. These are awarded by the DM for various reason. These are used to reward players for being good players. This includes, but is not limited to , good role play, risky plays, clever solutions to problems or anything that makes for good storytelling or good fun.

A player can cash in a bottle for 1 of two rewards. - give advantage to a player by letting the player roll twice and take the better result - give the DM disadvantage on a roll and forcing the DM to the take the worse result - (both exclude damage rolls)

Once a bottle is cashed, it can not be used again.

You can cash in a bottle cap after rolling but before you know the results of the roll.

## Crits

### FULL EXPLANATION

Critical hits and fumbles should be big events in the game, they stand for your character either being exceptionally skilled, or failing horribly for a reason. When a player rolls a crit/fumble. They will take a card and do what is on the card instead of hitting for (possibly) more damage

#### NEW RULE TL;DR;

When a named character (Player or PC) rolls to hit and they roll a natural 20, instead of confirming, the crit is auto confirmed and they drawn a critical card.

When a named character (Player or PC) rolls a critical that is not a natural 20, they need to confirm the crit in order to get card. if they fail to match a crit, they still get exploding dice on the damage roll.

when a named character (Player or PC) rolls a natural 1, they get a crticial fumble card

## Backstory
