### NORMAL
A player only gets the number of skills per level that are based by class

#### NEW RULE TL;DR;
Skills are now broken down into 2 different types, adventure and background. In addition to receiving the normal amount of 
skill points every level to go into any skills, a player now also receives 2 addition skill point to but into only background skills. This allows players to have skills that reflect their backstory without having to sacrifice play-ability

## Bottle Caps

### FULL EXPLANATION   
A player can earn bottle caps. These are awarded by the DM for various reason. These are used to reward players for being good players. This includes, but is not limited to , good role play, risky plays, clever solutions to problems or anything that makes for good storytelling or good fun. 

A player can cash in a bottle for 1 of two rewards. 
    - give advantage to a player by letting the player roll twice and take the better result
    - give the DM disadvantage on a roll and forcing the DM to the take the worse result
    - (both exclude damage rolls)

Once a bottle is cashed, it can not be used again. 

You can cash in a bottle cap after rolling but before you know the results of the roll.


## Crits

### FULL EXPLANATION   
Critical hits and fumbles should be big events in the game, they stand for your character either being exceptionally skilled, or failing horribly for a reason. When a player rolls a crit/fumble. They will take a card and do what is on the card instead of hitting for (possibly) more damage


#### NEW RULE TL;DR;

When a named character (Player or PC) rolls to hit and they roll a natural 20, instead of confirming, the crit is auto confirmed and they drawn a critical card. 

When a named character (Player or PC) rolls a critical that is not a natural 20, they need to confirm the crit in order to get card. if they fail to match a crit, they still get exploding dice on the damage roll. 

when a named character (Player or PC) rolls a natural 1, they get a crticial fumble card
